an admin dashboard built in react js , it uses formik/yup for input handeling, context hook for data management.
it connects to an express js backend.
note: the project was suppose to help a travel agency regulate their visa reservation orders.
it still needs work, heres a list of what should be done:
- refactore the formik yup code.
- hide api entry points in .env file, decided not to in this branch because i'm not really interested in the project anymore and to help set it up.
heres a live example on how it looks : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83pmBr92D8g&ab_channel=spacecowboy
use the project as you see fit :) good luck !
